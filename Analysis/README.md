# Analysis

This directory contains all data and analysis scripts for the biosecurity collective-risk social dilemma experiment.  

There are two main analysis folders:

- **Main_Analysis** – analysis of behavioural outcomes (biosecurity investments, outbreak frequency, payoffs, risk/loss aversion, trust, player strategies)

- **Communication_Analysis** – text-based analysis of participant chat data from the communication treatment (word frequencies, sentiment, emotion profiles)

Each analysis folder contains its own data and script.
